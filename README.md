# TelegramBot

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michael1011/telegrambot.svg?branch=master)

A simple Telegram bot for the Raspberry Pi

**How to use**

When you run the TelegramBot.jar (you can find the latest version in the releases) the file config.properties will be created.
Then you create a new Telegram bot ([Tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/quickly-create-a-telegram-bot-in-ruby/)) and replace the text next to "TelegramToken" with your token.
That's it. All other things are optional. Run the jar file again an it will work. 
Send your bot the message "hi" for further instructions.

If you want to run your bot in background use [Screen](http://www.computerhope.com/unix/screen.htm).
